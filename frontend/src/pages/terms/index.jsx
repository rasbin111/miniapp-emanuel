                        123 Fakturera is so easy and self-explanatory that the chance that you will need support is minimal, but if you should need support, we are here for you, with our office manned for the most part of the day. After the trial period, the subscription continues and costs SEK 99 excluding VAT per month, which is billed annually. If you do not want to keep the program, just cancel the trial period by giving notice before 14 days from registration.
